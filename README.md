# MultimodalMutationsPDAC
This repository include the implementation of the framework introduced by the work entitled "A Multimodal Framework for Assessing the Link between Pathomics, Transcriptomics, and Pancreatic Cancer Mutations".
The code is written in R and Python and it is structured as following:
1. _CLAM_, containing the code of "Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple Instance Learning" framework, edited for the imaging pipeline (feature extraction and classification).
2. _Transcriptomic_analysis_, containing the scripts for transcriptomic data analysis.
3. _Multimodal_analysis_, containing the code related to the "Naive" and to the "Neural" fusion layer, as well as metrics computation.
